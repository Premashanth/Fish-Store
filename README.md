# Fish-Store
javaFx  Store Project



This is the Coursework of the Programming Principle module. This is the javaFx based project which I made it in Netbeans.
I used scene builder to auto-generate codes for scenes. I used mySQL for connecting database. 
This javaFx based application will prompt username and password as the first interface. 
If the user have no account he can use signup for free button to create a new account. 
Then user have to login in to store and purchase products.
As the first step of the purchase he have to add items to cart and the he can view cart and make payment or 
he can continue purchasing. The database run is xampp environment.
